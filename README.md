# Guru_Shisya

Guru Shishya is a platform that will bridge the gap between knowledge Teachers and Students who are curious to learn.

We all know that, most of the time female teachers' want to earn some extra incentive but they can't get any option or platform for that. So we use this concept in our project to empower the female teachers as well as the student who are financially weak, by paying a small amount of money, they can learn by teachers and they guide them to a better future. According to our team, Everyone has right to Education. So, we are providing a platform to teacher to come then make their portfolio and their class time and the minimum fees. Student who visit to our website can browse the Course and Teachers and find their interest and join their webinar batch. We are just acting as a platform between Teacher and Student.

Teachers in their free or after school or college or evening time whenever they feel free, they will also gets some money for that paidby the student and student who are curious to study more are always welcome there.

We are not charging any money or taking any comission for this, We are just working as a Non-Profit Organization.
